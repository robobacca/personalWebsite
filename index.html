                        <p>
                            I am Samuel, I am 18 this year, and I am a second year student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. I am currently Pursuing a diploma in Information Technology.
                            I would consider myself a reflective learner, and someone who focuses on lessons learnt from failurs than failures themnselves. I am someone who analyses
                            every side of a topic, and understand each perspective bfore making a stand. I am also willing to lend a helping help to anyone, whether they need it or not.

                                SMO is a mathematics competition organised by the Singapore Mathermatics Society, where students apply mathematics concepts taught in secondary school to
                                extremely difficult Questions. This allows for a creative way of thinking, solving questions in an unorthodox manner.
                                Obtaining a bronze medal means an exceptional understanding of mathematics, and how to apply its concepts inro problems adaptively.

                                Having an honorable mention in the SJPO meant I was above average amongst those who joined the olumpiad. Despite me not winning any medals,
                                it showed I had a strong understanding of physics and SJPO introduced new topics that were extremely challenging for many people.

                                This competition challenged our understanding of programming robots, and how each function should be carried out. Despite it being 
                                my first time taking part in this competition, I achieved the top position in both the overall team challenge, and also the bonus
                                singles round. It was a step outside my comfort zone but I stepped up to the challenge.

                                Despite me not being first place, I was satisfied with the results. The competition was challenging and required us to solve both software

                                My Overall thoughts on this project is that it was an enjoyable experience. Stepping out of my comfort zone to lead the class as one of the 
                                project leader let me be more confident when speaking with people, especially strangers that I have not met before. The event went smoothly, and unlike what I expected. 
                                there weren't any major issues that would have hindered the project's progress. 
                            </p>

                                But this project did not just benefit me, it benefit the elderly as well. This gave them skillsets that are useful in our modern society, and this project allowed them 
                                to connect with the younger generation. With the ageing population, and the ever-increasing generation gap, this is an important benefit as it is a step 
                                towards bridging the gap.

                            <h3>Industry Talk: Google Keynote Day 1 (Google I/O 2021)</h3>
                            <p>Evidence of involvement</p>
                            <img src="ref2.png" style="width: 70%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
                            <p>
                                I chose to join the Google Keynote not only because it is the only few times I can attend a Google I/O talk live, but also because Google is an industry-leading company.
                                Understand where the competition lie, and what consumers want, is something important to someone like me who would join the tech industry in the future. Google showcased many 
                                fascinated concepts, such as using augmented reality in Google Mpas, and a new and ore complex Artificial Intellegence that makes translation sounds more natural 
                                and more like how a ntaive would phrase it. They also massively simplified android development, something I had hoped for for a long time.
                                 These improve the standard of living, which is one of the biggest goals all tech companies hope to achieve.

                                Overall the Google Keynote was an enjoyable experience, and a very informative talk that showcase what Google had to offer in the near future.
